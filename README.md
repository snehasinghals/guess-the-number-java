# Guess the Number (Java)

This is a simple Java console game I built for practice.  
The idea is pretty straightforward â€” the computer randomly picks a number between 0 and 99, and you have to guess it. After each guess, it tells you whether you're too high or too low until you get it right.

4. Keep guessing until you hit the right number.
